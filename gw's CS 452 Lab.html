    <h3> The Shared Memory Problem</h3>
    Because of its high speed and low overhead, developers often use
    shared
    memory
    as an interprocess communication mechanism.&nbsp; This technique is
    implemented by allowing processes to share the same data
    space.&nbsp;
    However, asynchronous access to shared memory may result in unusual
    and
    incorrect results.&nbsp; As mentioned in class and in your textbook,
    shared memory access presents users with an instance of the Critical
    Section problem.&nbsp; Recall the main issues involved with process
    synchronization while studying the following program:

    <h3>Shared Memory Synchronization</h3>
    This lab concerns itself primarily with mechanisms for controlling
    access to shared memory; specifically, it introduces
    semaphores.&nbsp;
    Like shared memory, semaphores are a kernel
    resource and follow the familiar resource usage pattern: request,
    use,
    release.
    <p>For semaphores, the resource usage paradigm is expressed as
      follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>a)&nbsp; obtain a semaphore set (often of size 1) <br>
      b)&nbsp; initialize the semaphore element(s) <br>
      c)&nbsp; use the semaphores correctly (i.e. <b><tt>wait()...signal()</tt></b>)<br>
      d)&nbsp; remove the kernel resource data structure</blockquote>
    Each of the steps above has an associated system call.&nbsp; The
    system
    calls are very similar to the calls used for shared memory.&nbsp;
    One
    of
    the main differences is that the functions are constructed to work
    with
    "sets" of semaphores - however, they can easily be used to
    manipulate a
    single semaphore.&nbsp; The functions corresponding to the above
    steps
    are:
    <blockquote>a)&nbsp; <b><tt>semget()</tt></b> - this function
      creates
      a
      semaphore set and initializes its elements to 0.&nbsp; It
      initializes a
      kernel data structure for operating system management of the
      resource
      and returns a resource ID to the user.&nbsp; This ID is used by
      any
      process wishing to use the semaphore. <br>
      b)&nbsp; <b><tt>semctl()</tt></b> - used for controlling the
      resource.&nbsp; This function is typically used to set (i.e.
      initialize)
      or query the values of semaphore elements. <br>
      c)&nbsp; <b><tt>semop()</tt></b> - used for incrementing,
      decrementing
      and testing the value of semaphore elements. <br>
      d)&nbsp; <b><tt>semctl()</tt></b> - used for controlling the
      resource.&nbsp; This function&nbsp; is also used to "free" the
      resource;
      removing the semaphore and its associated data structures from the
      system.</blockquote>
    Refer to the man pages for additional details on semaphore operation
    (you may also find the include files <tt>bits/ipc.h</tt> , <tt>sys/sem.h</tt>
    and <span style="font-family: monospace;">bits/sem.h</span>
    useful).
    <p>The code snippets below demonstrate the use of these system
      calls: </p>
    <p>/*&nbsp; create a new semaphore set for use by this (and other) processes.. <br>
      */ <br>
      <b><tt>semId = semget (IPC_PRIVATE, 1, 00600));</tt></b> </p>
    <p>/*&nbsp;&nbsp;initialize the semaphore set referenced by
      the
      previously obtained <b><tt>semId</tt></b> handle. <br>
      */ <br>
      <b><tt>semctl (semId, 0, SETVAL, 1);</tt></b> </p>
    <p>/*&nbsp; the <b><tt>semop()</tt></b> function is used to perform
      operations on semaphore elements (for example, to do the
      equivalent of
      the Wait() and Signal() operations).&nbsp; <b><tt>semId</tt></b>
      is
      the
      semaphore set ID obtained previously, <b><tt>sbuf</tt></b> is the
      name
      of a user variable (i.e. a data object) of type <b><tt>sembuf</tt></b>.&nbsp;
The
values
of
      the <b><tt>sembuf</tt></b> structure are filled in by
      the
      user and used by the system to determine the nature of the operation to be
      performed.&nbsp;
      Refer to the man pages and the <tt><font size="+1">.h</font></tt>
      files
      for more detail on this structure and its use. <br>
      */ <br>
      <b><tt>semop (semId, &amp;sbuf, 1);</tt></b> </p>
    <p>//&nbsp; remove the semaphore referenced by <b><tt>semId</tt></b>
      <br>
      <b><tt>semctl (semId, 0, IPC_RMID);</tt></b> </p>
    <p>Note that the <b><tt>semctl()</tt></b> function call is
      used
      for initializing and also for removing the semaphore.&nbsp; It
      uses a
      different syntax (and a different number of arguments) depending
      on the
      usage desired. </p>

    </h3>
    <h3> Miscellaneous Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Recall that the system utility "<b><tt>ipcs</tt></b>" (IPC
        status) displays information about currently allocated kernel
        IPC
        resources, including semaphores.&nbsp; The system utility "<b><tt>ipcrm</tt></b>"
        (IPC
        remove)
        is used for semaphore removal.&nbsp; Use this utility to
        clean up resources in the event of programming errors.</li>
      <li> The process that creates shared memory or semaphores should
        be
        responsible for:</li>
      <ul>
        <li> creation</li>
        <li> verifying that no segment or semaphore set with the same ID
          number exists</li>
        <li> establishing access permissions</li>
        <li> cleanup and deallocation</li>
      </ul>
      <li> All of these tasks are controlled by the flags passed to the
        respective <b><tt>get()</tt></b> and <b><tt>ctl()</tt></b>
        functions.&nbsp; As usual, read the man pages!&nbsp;</li><li>Similar
to signals, there are both&nbsp;System V and&nbsp;POSIX versions of semaphores.
&nbsp;All systems implement the SysV version (which you should use for
this lab). &nbsp;Some systems also include POSIX semaphores, which are sometimes reserved for real-time threads.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>&nbsp;<br>
    </h3>
    <h3>Programming Assignment (Controlled Process Synchronization)</h3>
    The programmer's goal is to implement controlled, asynchronous
    access
    to shared memory; in this lab it is to properly synchronize access
    to
    the critical sections of&nbsp;Sample Program 1.&nbsp; The
    main idea
    of this assignment is to demonstrate that with the use of proper
    synchronization mechanisms, the expected value is <span style="font-style: italic;">always</span> obtained
    from
    the program.
    <ul>
      <li> Protect<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>the
        critical
        sections in Sample Program 1 to prevent
        memory access conflicts from causing inconsistencies in the
        output.&nbsp; Your
        solution should still maximize potential parallelism.<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li> insert the appropriate code to create and initialize a
          semaphore</li>
        <li> use semaphore operations to synchronize the two processes</li>
        <li> perform required cleanup operations</li>
        <li> test that your Sample Program works correctly</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; Semaphore creation and initialization are two
    different, hence non-atomic operations.&nbsp; Be sure they have both
    been completed before another process attempts to access the
    semaphore.<br>
    <h3><br>
    </h3>
    <h3>Extra Credit (Semaphore Toolkit)<br>
    </h3>Although
their functionality is identical, these real-world semaphore operations
look very different from&nbsp;the versions presented in class (and found in the textbook).
&nbsp;Can the differences be reconciled?<br><br>Create your own library consisting of a complete
semaphore toolkit.&nbsp; The idea is to be able to make simple function
calls to your library that look similar to the semaphore operations 
described in class and in the textbook.&nbsp; Your library should
provide&nbsp;functionality to create, initialize, wait,
signal, and destroy a semaphore.&nbsp; For example:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>the prototype '<span style="font-family: monospace;">void Wait
          (int);</span>'&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the familiar 'wait(S)' function, and is found in an include file</li>
      <li>the actual code for the <span style="font-family: monospace;">Wait()</span>
        function
        would be defined and compiled into your library, and linked into your program</li>
      <li>the function would be used by a program as in '<span style="font-family: monospace;">Wait (semID);</span>'</li>
    </ul>
    This
    toolkit can then be re-used in the future whenever you are writing a program that requires process
    synchronization.<br>
    <br>
    To create a library (toolkit):<br>
    <ul>
      <li>for a static library, begin by looking at <span style="font-weight: bold;">ar </span>and/or <span style="font-weight: bold;">ranlib</span></li>
      <li>for a dynamicly-linked library, look for the appropriate compiler
        options
        to specify <span style="font-style: italic;">position-independent code</span> and code-sharing<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
